  <span slot="title">Better Ice means Loyalty</span>
  <span slot="desc"> Ever hold a piece of clear, heavy glacial ice? It’s incredibly pure and dense, so it takes an amazingly long time to melt. Our cutting-edge purification technology results in similarly dense, fresh-tasting ice which melts more slowly than ordinary ice. Bulk-ice customers will notice that our ice lasts longer, and come back, each day, for more. </span>
</Heroic>


<!-- Bagged ice takes a lot of storage space. So it is often placed past the register, making it the single most "forgotten" purchse. How often have you walked out of a store, past the ice refrigerator and, only then, remembered that you forgot the ice? Our ice machines are compact, and sit outside facing the customer as they fill up with gas or load their groceries. There is no need to go back into the store and wait in line to grab ice.  -->

  <span slot="title">More Foot-traffic for You</span>
  <span slot="desc">
    Arizona is hot. We have an entire sector of our economy who depend on ice to work outdoors effectively. You’ve seen their trucks, each having a cooler strapped to the back. These customers need to fill bulk ice every day. And once they try our ice, they will love how long it lasts in their cooler. Then they will return every day for more &mdash; driving traffic to your store.

<Heroic url="/mckinly2_vert.png" dir="left" id="revenue">
  <span slot="title">Revenue Shared with You</span>
  <span slot="desc">Trucked ice simply cannot compete in quality or cost. While they might someday upgrade their filtering equipment, yet they just cannot get around the high-overhead of fuel and labor involved in handling, trucking and storage of legacy bagged ice. Our machines manufacture the ice onsite with no human contamination or cost. This allows us to sell better ice at a lower price with substantially better profit margin. And since good location is so important, we can push a revenue share back to you as the business owner.  </span>

<Heroic url="/mckinly4_vert.png" dir="right" id="bonus">
  <span slot="title">Fat Signing Bonus for You</span>
  <span slot="desc">Our machines are expensive &mdash; 20x the cost of a typical vending machine, which means quality placement is critical. Since good placement is so important to us, we go ahead and put a premium on solid location contracts in the form of a significant signing bonus for you, the business owner. That's right, in addition to healthy monthly rent, we give you a fat cash signing bonus &mdash; putting money in your pocket from day one.</span>
</Heroic>

<Heroic url="/mckinley5_vert.png" dir="left" id="service">
  <span slot="title">Broad Service Area across Arizona</span>
  <span slot="desc"> Our machines are expensive because they’re engineered to require very little maintenance. Each machine has smart remote monitoring and even live customer chat support. This allows us to provide service across the entire state of Arizona. <br>If you own a gas station, an RV park, or a truck stop and would like to add an excellent additional income stream, contact us for a free site assessment.</span>
